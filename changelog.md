# What's New?

## February 17, 2021

#### üöÄ Major updates

* We were busy this week improving ‚Äúbehind-the-scenes‚Äù performance for your scripts running on the WayScript platform. By changing the way we cache library dependencies \(as installed from your Python, JavaScript, or Java code\), your scripts should execute faster, especially after the first time they are run.
* We also elevated code performance for accounts on our Superhero tier by improving process isolation for your script runs.

#### üîÑ Module refinements

* ![](.gitbook/assets/datadog.png) We added [trigger](library/triggers/datadog-trigger.md) capability to our [Datadog](library/modules/datadog.md) module. You can now execute your script based on when an event is generated in your Datadog monitoring environment.

#### üêû Additional improvements

* WayScript [Variables](getting_started/variables.md), both in the left Variable panel and when added to modules, now display the variable data type on mouse-over \(hover\) for easy reference.
* We made a few different performance improvements to working with code within the WayScript [Code Editors](getting_started/code-editors.md). The experience of manipulating code should feel snappier!
* We fixed a few errors in our [Excel](library/modules/excel.md) and [CSV](library/modules/csv.md) modules.
  * We fixed an error where, in some scripts, only the first row of a `.xlsx` file was written to when passing in a List variable.
  * We fixed an error parsing `‚Äù` characters when exporting data to a `.csv` file.
* We fixed a few issues within the WayScript Log.
  * Line numbers displayed in the Log should now align with what is displayed in the Code Editor, even if you add multiple Code steps to your script.
  * Passing string data to the Log from Code modules or the [Print to Log](library/logic/print-to-log.md) module now properly displays apostrophes, new lines, and other special characters.
* We made additional improvements to script execution to prevent certain instances of ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù running states.
* We fixed an error some users were encountering when trying to clone shared scripts before signing in.

## February 10, 2021

#### üöÄ Major updates

* Continuing our efforts to improve WayScript‚Äôs internal [Code Editor](getting_started/code-editors.md), we added the ability for you to set custom preferences under your script‚Äôs settings to modify the look and feel of the editor environment. These preferences apply by default in all scripts in your account.
  * `Key Map`  - Select from a few common libraries of keyboard shortcuts to help you feel at home in the WayScript editor
  * `Font`  - Choose from a few common font options for optimal code legibility
  * `Tab Size`  - Pick your intended tab length \(4 or 2 spaces\)
  * `Insert Spaces`  - Toggle whether to insert spaces after brackets or commas
  * `Show Spaces`  - Toggle whether to mark spaces with the ‚Ä¢ character
  * `Show End of Line`  - Toggle whether to mark EOL with the ¬¨ character
  * `Underline Trailing Whitespace`  - Toggle whether to underline trailing whitespace after code block
  * `Show Tabs`  - Toggle whether to show ‚Ä¢ characters to signify tab level
* To ensure you never lose a change to your script, we added a saved icon ![](.gitbook/assets/black.png) to the right side of the navigation bar with the WayScript editor to indicate that your script changes have successfully saved.
  * If you lose network connection or if there is any other error saving your script, this icon will change to a caution symbol ![](.gitbook/assets/caution_black.png) and message will appear asking you to try saving again.
  * Please do not navigate away from your script editor until the editor displays the saved icon or you may lose changes you recently made to your script.

#### üêû Additional improvements

* We fixed a few occasional issues caused by moving the step order of code modules.
* We also continued to improve editor cursor tracking and fixed any issues with saving real-time edits to code or text files stored in the WayScript [File System](getting_started/file-system.md).
* We improved the ordering of variable selection when using the \* operator with a WayScript List or Struct [Variable](getting_started/variables.md).
* We made a few updates to improve the usability of WayScript through mobile viewports. While a desktop viewport is ideal for editing your scripts, check out WayScript when you‚Äôre on the go.

## February 3, 2021

#### üöÄ Major updates

* We made quite a few changes to WayScript‚Äôs internal [Code Editors ](getting_started/code-editors.md)to improve the experience of manipulating code in Python, JavaScript, or any of our supported languages.
  * We changed our process of saving to make it much easier to highlight, cut, and paste text within the editor while the WayScript platform saves your code automatically.
  * We added an indicator to show matching brackets near your cursor, and you can now auto-generate closing brackets `() {} ‚Äú‚Äù ‚Äò‚Äô` .
  * We added the ability to select multiple instances of the same text through multiple cursors.
    * `Cmd/Ctrl + D` : Select all instances of the selected text
    * `Cmd/Ctrl + K` : Skip instance of selected text
  * We added functionality to search and replace text.
    * `Cmd/Ctrl + F` : Start searching for selected text
    * `Cmd/Ctrl + G` : Find next instance of selected text
    * `Shift + Cmd/Ctrl + G` : Find previous instance of selected text
    * `Shift + Cmd/Ctrl + F` : Replace selected instance with new text
    * `Shift+ Ctrl+ R` / `Shift + Cmd + Option + F`  - Replace all instances with new text
* We redesigned our [Conditionals](library/logic/conditionals.md) modules to make it easier to write conditional statements in the Settings panel.
  * You can now use syntax like `not` and `()`  to create more robust conditions in your Logic modules.
  * **Note:** Comparing string variables in our new conditional statements is now an exact match \(case sensitive and including leading and trailing spaces\). To replicate previous behavior, you need to update your conditional statement to include `<variable_name>.strip().lower()` for each string variable.
* WayScript‚Äôs File System continues to get better each and every week. Based on user feedback, we‚Äôve added support for accessing your file system in code modules using ‚Äúabsolute‚Äù paths starting with `/<username>`. For example, you can now reference a file in Python with a reference such as, `data = open(‚Äô/test_user/file.txt‚Äô).read()`
* If you received runtime credit from our WayScript team, it should now be visible on your Account Settings page along with your monthly runtime remaining and storage remaining. All users on the Hero tier receive 30-minutes of runtime per month and 50 MB of storage, but you can upgrade to our Superhero tier to receive unlimited runtime and storage.

#### üîÑ Module refinements

* ![](.gitbook/assets/has_changed.png) We created a new [Variable has Changed](library/logic/variable-has-changed.md) Logic module to help you simply track if a WayScript variable in your script has been modified between script runs.
* ![](.gitbook/assets/trello%20%281%29%20%282%29%20%281%29.png) When using our[ Trello Trigger](library/triggers/trello-trigger.md), the Change\_List and Changed\_Card structs now output the correct values.
* ![](.gitbook/assets/stripe.png) The [Stripe](library/modules/stripe.md) module now supports outputting [payouts](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts).
* ![](.gitbook/assets/java_code.png) New [Java Package](library/modules/java/packages.md) dependencies now install significantly faster.

#### üêû Additional improvements

* We fixed a few occasional issues around running functions and stopping running instances of functions.
* We fixed scattered issues around authenticating and deleting your Linked Accounts through the Settings panel.
* We investigated some issues causing slow performance, so the WayScript platform should feel more responsive and have fewer disconnects.
* Our Discord widget should be back up and running. We‚Äôd love to have you in our Discord community if you haven‚Äôt yet joined; it‚Äôs the fastest way to get answers to any questions you have while building on the WayScript platform.

## January 20th, 2021

* üé® We've launched an updated look-and-feel for the site, with a more streamlined color palette! Let us know what you think!

## December 11th, 2020

* üìÇ Announcing the launch of our file system! With this system, every user gets a file directory for their scripts and you can reference this folder environment in your code. For example, if you create a file in [Python](library/modules/python/) code, that file will persist and you can utilize it in WayScript modules. Please check it out and let us know what you think!

* ![](.gitbook/assets/google.png) We have added the option to [Log in with Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/112802), which will work with your existing WayScript email address, so long as it's associated with an existing Google account. 
* JSON outputs are now structs. **This is possibly a breaking change, if you have referenced these outputs in a code module.**

## July 29th, 2020

* You can now choose to run your [Function Calls](library/logic/functions/function-call.md) asynchronously, using the [Run Async](library/logic/functions/function-call.md#running-a-function-asynchronously) setting. One common use-case for this setting is to immediately return a `200 Success` response from the [HTTP Response](library/modules/http-response.md) module, while performing a long-running task on a background thread. 
* The [Form Trigger](library/triggers/form-trigger.md) now allows users to [upload and submit PDF files](library/triggers/form-trigger.md#5-file-upload), which you can then use later in your script.

Click on the WayScript logo in the navigation bar to check it out!

![](.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-03-25-at-11.07.48-am.png)

## March 13th, 2020

* We have updated the variable selectors and inputs in the script editor to make working with variables easier than ever! 
* The [YouTube module](library/modules/youtube.md) now lets you search for videos on a specific channel, using the [Channel ID](library/modules/youtube.md#inputs) advanced setting. 
* The endpoints for [Form](library/triggers/form-trigger.md) and [HTTP](library/triggers/http-trigger.md) triggers have **moved to** [**wayscript.io**](http://wayscript.io/).
  * To access your Form and HTTP endpoints, you should now use the script ID as a subdomain of **wayscript.io**.  \(e.g. [1234.wayscript.io](https://1234.wayscript.io)\)
  * Existing wayscript_.com_ endpoints will redirect to wayscript_.io_ for the time being, so your current scripts will continue to work.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please update your code to consume the latest WayScript [Python](https://pypi.org/project/wayscript/) and [JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wayscript) packages and change any POST requests to call **wayscript.io**.

Legacy wayscript._com_ Form and HTTP endpoints will be disabled in the future and you will eventually be required to use the new wayscript._io_ endpoints.
{% endhint %}

## March 6th, 2020

* We have added a new [Chart Module](library/modules/chart.md),  which allows you to create [line](library/modules/chart.md#line-chart) and [pie](library/modules/chart.md#pie-chart) charts.
  * üìäBar charts coming soon!
  * [Chart variables](getting_started/variables.md#chart) can be placed in a [Dashboard Response](library/modules/dashboard-response.md), [Print to Log](library/logic/print-to-log.md) statement, and other places you would expect to see output.

![Example line chart](.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-03-06-at-1.32.20-pm.png)

* We have updated the [Form Trigger](library/triggers/form-trigger.md) to have [customizable endpoints](library/triggers/form-trigger.md#endpoints) and [password protection](library/triggers/form-trigger.md#password-protect-your-form), similar to the [HTTP Trigger](library/triggers/http-trigger.md). 
* The [Google Sheets](library/modules/google-sheets.md) module has a new [Preserve Header Row](library/modules/google-sheets.md#preserve-header-row) setting for use when you are writing to a spreadsheet with both the "[Replace File](library/modules/google-sheets.md#write-mode)" and "[Include Headers](library/modules/google-sheets.md#include-headers)" options enabled and would like to replace everything EXCEPT the header row on each run of your script.

## February 27th, 2020

* You can now import and reference code from other Python and JavaScript files in your scripts. \(See the [Python](library/modules/python/#importing-code-from-other-files) and [JavaScript](library/modules/javascript.md#importing-code-from-other-files) module docs for more information on how to do this.\)

![Example of importing the function &quot;bar&quot; from &quot;foo.py&quot;](.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-02-18-at-2.06.44-pm.png)

* We have two new modules for reading and writing [.JSON](library/modules/json.md) and [.TXT ](library/modules/txt-file.md)files. 
* We have revamped the [Account Settings page](https://wayscript.com/settings). For details on managing your account, check out the [Account Management](https://docs.wayscript.com/account-management) section of the docs.

## February 19th, 2020

* We have added a [Form Trigger](library/triggers/form-trigger.md), which allows you to build a web form for your script. When the form is submitted, the script is triggered with the form data. You can add [text inputs](library/triggers/form-trigger.md#1-text-input) and [text areas](library/triggers/form-trigger.md#2-text-area), [selectors](library/triggers/form-trigger.md#3-selector), and [radio buttons](library/triggers/form-trigger.md#4-radio-buttons). You can even customize the look and feel of your form with [your own CSS](library/triggers/form-trigger.md#advanced).

![Example form](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-02-18-11.49.15.png)

* We have added a new [Dashboard Response](library/modules/dashboard-response.md) module, which will render script variables to a beautiful dashboard interface. You can use this response in conjunction with the [Form Trigger](library/triggers/form-trigger.md), as well as the [HTTP Trigger](library/triggers/http-trigger.md).

![Example dashboard response](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-02-18-12.09.49.png)

* In the [Python](library/modules/python/#working-with-variables) and [JavaScript](library/modules/javascript.md#working-with-variables) modules, we have made working with variables easier by adding a "variables" dictionary. This dictionary can be used to reference variables from your script in your Python and JavaScript code, as well as output new variables into your script. \(The "variables" dictionary replaces the old "inputs" and "outputs" dictionaries, although these legacy dictionaries are still available, so your existing scripts won't break.\)

```python
# Read in variables created previously in your script
x = variables[ 'An_Existing_Variable' ]

# Create new variables for use later in your script
variables[ 'First_Output' ] = 'Testing'
```

* We have updated the [Create Variable](library/logic/create-variable.md) module so that you can now declare variables using "Pythonic" syntax and create multiple variables of different types in the same step. You can also [edit variable values](library/logic/create-variable.md#updating-the-value-of-a-variable) using the Create Variable module. For a tutorial on creating variables in WayScript, see the ["Variables" section of Getting Started](getting_started/variables.md).
