* Added the [JavaScript module](library/modules/javascript.md), where you can compose and run your own custom JavaScript code as part of your scripts. This module also allows you to [define custom npm dependencies](library/modules/javascript.md#adding-dependencies).
* Added [Else-If](library/logic/conditionals.md#if-else-if-else) functionality to the [Conditional](getting_started/conditionals.md#add-branches) logic module.
* Added a [While Loop](library/logic/loop/while-loop.md) module.

* Added a [Template Library](https://wayscript.com/library), where you can get started with ready-made scripts. This replaces the Sidekick functionality.
* You can now [define custom requirements](library/modules/python/#adding-additional-requirements) in the Python module and edit your code in an expanded full-screen mode.
