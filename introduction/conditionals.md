## What is a condition?

In computer science, conditional statements are features of a programming language, which perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified _condition_ is true or false.

## Creating conditions in WayScript

### Create a Variable

For this example, we create a variable called Number and set it to the value 4.

### Create a Condition

Drag the "If" module from your Logic Panel as the next step in your program.

### Define your Conditions

For this example, we want to build logic that says "**IF** our Number variable is greater than or equal to 100 - then print "This is a big number", **ELSE** print "This is a small number".

### Define Your Worflow Actions

We can now define different sets of actions on each **branch** of the conditional. If the condition is **True,** it will execute one set of actions, otherwise it will run a different set of actions.

### Run your Program

Press the 'Run Main' button to run your program. You can see, the If statement evaluated to False \(because 4 is not greater than or equal too 100\). Therefore, our program prints "This is a small number!".

Try changing the number of your Number variable and rerunning the program.
