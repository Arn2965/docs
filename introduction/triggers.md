## What are Triggers?

So far in this introduction, we have run our programs by pressing the 'Run Main' button. Whether you realized it or not - this button is a trigger! Triggers are events you can set which cause your program to run \(in the Run Main case it was just pressing the button\). However, there are all types of triggers you can set up to run your programs.
