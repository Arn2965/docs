# Variables

## What is a Variable?

"**Variables** are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. This data can then be used throughout your program." - LaunchSchool

## Create Variable Setup

Drag the **Create Variable** module into your program flow diagram.

![The Create Variable module is in your Logic Panel](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2019-07-15-12.28.05.png)

Once dropped, WayScript will automatically display the Settings Panel for your Create Variable step. This is where you are going to set up your variable.

## Single Item

For this example, we are going to create a **Variable Name** called "Location" and set it to the **Variable Value** "Brooklyn, NY". Feel free to put in your own location instead.
