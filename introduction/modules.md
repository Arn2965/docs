  WayScript modules, how they work, and how you can use them to do awesome
  things with your programs.

## What is a Module?

WayScript modules give you the ability to autoamte tasks and work with third party applications from your program. The easiest way to think of a Module is with the analogy of an assembly line. First, you **setup** your machines to your specifications, then you **input** the necessary components, then work is done, and finally you get a shiny new **output**. WayScript leverages third party APIs to let you treat these applications and tools as steps in your assembly line.
