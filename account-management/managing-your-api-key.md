## ðŸ”„ Resetting Your API Key

To reset your API Key, click the "Refresh API Key" button under the API Key listed in your profile page.

You will see a dialog asking you to confirm the reset. If you reset your API Key, you will need to update any [WayScript API ](../apis/rest.md)calls in your code to use the new key.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Regenerating your API Key will reset the key for all WayScript [webhooks](../library/triggers/webhook-trigger.md). This action cannot be reversed.
