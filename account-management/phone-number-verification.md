# Phone Number Verification

## ðŸ“± Adding a Phone Number

There are two ways to add a phone number to your WayScript account:

1. When you first drag in a module that requires a linked phone number \([Text Message](../library/modules/text-message.md), [Text Message Trigger](../library/triggers/text-message-trigger.md)\). You will be prompted to verify your phone number. 
2. Edit your Account Info in your [Account Settings page](https://wayscript.com/settings).

## âœ… Verification Process

First, enter your number in the "Provide a Phone Number" dialog when prompted.

Next, in the "Verify Your Phone Number" dialog, click "Send Code" to receive a one-time verification code via text message. \(Standard text messaging rates apply\).
