## Setup

In order for your speech to be read, you must include an Alexa Trigger in your program and launch the program from an Alexa-enabled device.

See the [Alexa Trigger documentation](../triggers/alexa-trigger.md) for more details. 

### Speech Text

Enter the phrase you would like Alexa to speak in the "Speech Text" field.

You can include variable values by dragging them into this field from the Variables panel.

{% hint style="info" %}
Speech Text has a maximum length of 600 characters. Messages over that limit will be truncated.
{% endhint %}
