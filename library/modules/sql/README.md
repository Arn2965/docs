## \*\*\*\*‚úè **Compose Your SQL Query**

Compose your SQL query using the Code Editor.

You can run your query by clicking the "Run Code" button, or by running your program.

## \*\*\*\*üì§ **Outputs**

Any data returned by your SQL query will be displayed as a table in the "Outputs" section.

To use output data elsewhere in your program, assign a name to each column of data you want to use. The column will then appear as a list variable in your "Variables" panel.
