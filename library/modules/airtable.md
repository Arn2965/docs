# Airtable

![Airtable works like a spreadsheet, but gives you the power of a database to organize anything.](../../.gitbook/assets/airtable.png)

## ![](../../.gitbook/assets/airtable.png) Functionality

With the Airtable module you can:

* Read Table Data into WayScript
* Delete Table Rows
* Create New Table Rows
* Update a Row

## ‚öô Setting Up Your Airtable Account

### 1. Drag the Airtable module into your WayScript program

### 2. **In the Airtable Module, select "Add an Account" in the "Select an API Key" input**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/add_an_account.png)

### **3. A form will pop-up that allows you to connect your Airtable account**

### **5. Select the "base" you want to automate with WayScript**

In this example, we are using the "Event Marketing" base. Click on the base.

## üíº Working with a Table

Choose the table you want to work with in the "Table Name" input. \(In this case, the "Events" table.\)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/events.png)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/table_input.png)

### üîé Select an Operation

Choose whether you would like to **Get Records**, **Delete Rows**, or **Create a New Record**.

![What would you like to do?](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2019-07-15-at-7.55.25-pm%20%281%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29.png)

### üóÉ Get Records

The "Get Records" option allows you to retrieve data from a table.

You can choose whether you want to retrieve **All Rows**, rows that match a **Filter**, or a **Single Row**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2019-07-15-at-7.55.46-pm.png)

#### All Rows \( Optional Inputs \):

* **Filter By Formula** : Provide a formula to filter results. The formula will be evaluated for each record, and if the result is not `0`, `false`, `""`, `NaN`, `[]`, or `#Error!` the record will be included in the response. For example, to only include records where Name isn't empty, pass in `NOT({Name} = '')`
* **Max Records :** The maximum total number of records that will be returned in your requests
* **Page Size:**  The number of records returned in each request. Must be less than or equal to 100. Default is 100
* **Sort :**  A list of sort objects that specifies how the records will be ordered. Each sort object must have a `field` key specifying the name of the field to sort on, and an optional `direction` key that is either `"asc"` or `"desc"`

  For example, to sort records by Name in descending order, pass in: `[{field: "Name", direction: "desc"}]`

* **View :**  The name or ID of a view in the testing table. If set, only the records in that view will be returned.

#### Filter Results

If you choose the "Filter" or "Single Row" option, you will need to define the filter you want to match on.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2019-07-15-at-7.55.59-pm.png)

#### Matching Rows

All rows matching your settings above will display in the "Inputs" section.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2019-07-15-at-8.10.10-pm.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Click the "Refresh" button for the most up-to-date results.
{% endhint %}

### ‚ùå Delete Rows

The "Delete Rows" option works much in the same way as the "Get Records" option, but deletes any matching records instead of retrieving them.

### üåü Create a New Record

You also have the option to Create a New Record.

If you choose this option, you can either:

* Build the data you would like to create using WayScript
* Input raw JSON

#### Build Data

If you opt to build Data yourself, you will need to define each of the field values of the new row you wish to input into the table.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-21-at-11.02.37-am.png)

![The new row created](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-21-at-11.05.01-am.png)

Raw JSON

If you opt to input raw JSON, you will need to select the WayScript variable that contains that JSON or Hardcoded JSON. Both of them need to be in the following forma \(The same format as a Fields JSON output item in Get Records\) :

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-21-at-11.06.29-am.png)

### ‚úè Update a Row

#### Update Type

* **PATCH** - A PATCH request will only update the fields you specify, leaving the rest as they were
* **PUT** - A PUT request will perform a destructive update and clear all unspecified cell values.

#### Submission Type

Build Data \(Recommended\)

* **Inputs:**
  * **Record ID** - The ID of the Record you want to update. This can be retrieved using the [Get Records](airtable.md#get-records) mode.
  * **Fields -** This is where you put the Key and Value that you want to update. The Key is the name of the column, the value is the new value you want for that cell. 

Input Raw JSON \(Advanced\)

* This mode allows you to input your own JSON or Struct into Airtable. The json MUST fit this structure:

```python
{ 
  'id' : '<INSERT_RECORD_ID>',
  'fields' : { 'column name' : 'new value', } 
}
```

#### Output

```graphql
Success: Bool //This tells you if the row successfully updated
```

## üì§ Outputs

Each column of your table will be available to select as an output from the Airtable module.
