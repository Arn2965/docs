# Python

See [Code Editors](../../../getting_started/code-editors.md) for more information on composing code in WayScript.

## ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/create_var.png)Working with Variables

###  ðŸ“¥ Inputs

WayScript's python editor lets you reference [Variables](../../../getting_started/variables.md) that exist in your program. To do this, you can reference them through the **variables dictionary**.

As an example, let's create a variable called "Location" and set a value of "Brooklyn, NY"

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2019-07-16-14.03.23.png)

You can reference the Location variable in your python script with this code:

```python
location = variables[ "Location" ]
```

More abstractly, you reference any variable with the format:

```python
var = variables[ "<var_name>" ] 
```

### ðŸ“¤ Outputs

You can also output data from your python scripts and turn these into variables that can be used by other [Modules](../../../getting_started/modules.md) in your program. 

You can do this with the **variables dictionary** in the following format:

```python
variables[ "<Var Name>" ] = variable

# example
from datetime import datetime
variables[ "Date" ] = str( datetime.today() )
```

## â–¶ Running Python

While working on your script, you can press the "Run Code" button inside the Python module to run the Python code and see updated results.

## ðŸ“¦ Adding Additional Requirements

The Python module comes with [many pre-installed Python Libraries](libraries.md). However, if you would like to use a module that isn't already installed, you can declare those requirements in the "Requirements.txt" file.

Declare these requirements as you would in a [pip Requirements File](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files), using the [Requirements File Format](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirements-file-format).

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-01-23-at-6.19.16-pm.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
For faster code execution, only add requirements that aren't already [pre-installed](libraries.md) in the Python module.
{% endhint %}

### ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/github%20%281%29.png) Referencing Python GitHub Repositories

To consume a Python GitHub repo as a package in your code, use the following format in your `requirements.txt` file:

```python
git+https://github.com/wayscript/wayscript-python.git#egg=wayscript
```

This example will install the `wayscript-python` package from GitHub, with the [egg](https://wiki.python.org/moin/egg) named "wayscript".

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order for this to work properly, you may also need to add all Python requirements from the project you are referencing to your `requirements.txt` file as well.
{% endhint %}

## â†˜ Importing Code from Other Files

You can import code from the other Python files in your File Browser. For example, suppose you have a file called `foo.py`, which has a method `bar`.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-02-18-at-2.06.29-pm.png)

You can import and use the `bar` method in `scratch.py` by using a relative import:

```python
from .foo import bar
```
