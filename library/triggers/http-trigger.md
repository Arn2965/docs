# HTTP Trigger

![Trigger a function when a user goes to a URL.](../../.gitbook/assets/http%20%281%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
To display a webpage back to the user, use the [HTTP Response](../modules/http-response.md) module.
{% endhint %}

## ‚öô Setup

The HTTP Trigger is used to setup a web request. You can use it to implement a web page endpoint, a json post request, or other types of web requests.

### üîó Endpoints

To set up the HTTP Trigger, give your endpoint a name. You can also leave the field blank to match the root URL. You can add multiple endpoints.

To access the endpoint, use the program ID as a subdomain of wayscript.com. For example, in the image above, you could access this endpoint using https://8503.wayscript.com/endpoint.

Remember to Activate your trigger before using the endpoint.

### üîê Password-Protect your Endpoints

If you would like the endpoints in your HTTP trigger to require a login to view, uncheck the "Publicly Accessible" checkbox.

A button to "Manage Login Credentials" will appear.

Clicking this button will take you to the "Script Setup" tab, where you can manage the usernames and passwords that will allow people to log in to your endpoints.

When you click "Add a credential," a new login will be automatically generated for you, including a username and randomly-generated password. You can choose to use these values, or edit them as you see fit.

When a user goes to access your endpoint for the first time, they will now be prompted to login.

### Basic Authentication

If you password-protect your endpoints, you can access them without the login endpoint by including an `Authorization` header in your request.

This header should follow the standard for [HTTP basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). For example, suppose your Username is "**captain@wayscript.com**" and your Password is "**letmein**," you would create the `Authorization` header by:

1. Joining the Username and Password into a single string, separated by a semicolon: **`captain@wayscript.com:letmein`**
2. Encoding that string in Base64: **`Y2FwdGFpbkB3YXlzY3JpcHQuY29tOmxldG1laW4=`**
3. Passing that encoded string to your custom endpoint by including the `Authorization: Basic` **`Y2FwdGFpbkB3YXlzY3JpcHQuY29tOmxldG1laW4=`** header in your request.
