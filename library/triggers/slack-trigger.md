You can scope the trigger to a specific channel and/or user, or allow the notification to fire for any channel and/or user.

Additionally, you can exclude messages from bots. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Exclude messages from bots if you have a WayScript program that is posting as a bot to a channel that triggers the same WayScript program, so your WayScript program doesn't trigger itself.
{% endhint %}

## ðŸ“¤Outputs

Select what event data you would like to retrieve as a program variable and set default values.

The Slack Channel, Slack User, and Raw JSON Data from the Slack event are always available as outputs.

If you chose the "message was posted to a channel" event type, the Slack Message Text will also be available.
