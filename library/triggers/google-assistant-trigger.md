Useful when your program name is long or difficult for the Google Assistant to understandâ€Œ

## â€‹ ðŸ—£ Voice Commands <a id="voice-commands"></a>

### â€‹âž¡ Pass in Spoken Input <a id="pass-in-spoken-input"></a>

To pass the input in your voice command, add "with \[Variable Value\]" to your Google Assistant phrase.â€Œ

You can pass an argument to your Google Assistant-Triggered program by enabling the "Spoken Input" variable in the Outputs panel.

Suppose your program is called 'Stocks' and takes a single input called \[Symbol\] as input, you could then speak the following phrase to the Google Assistant:

> "Hey Google, ask WayScript Trigger to run 'Stocks' with AAPL."

### â€‹ðŸ’¬ Speak a Phrase <a id="speak-a-phrase"></a>

Once you have added the Google Assistant Trigger to a program, you can include the [Google Assistant module](../modules/google-assistant.md), which will allow the Google Assistant to speak to you while your program is running.â€Œ

You can reference variables that were created earlier in the program and insert them into an Google Assistant Phrase. See the [Google Assistant module documentation](../modules/google-assistant.md) for more details.â€Œ
