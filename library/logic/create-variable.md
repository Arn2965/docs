## ðŸ”¤ **Creating a Variable**

Creating variables in WayScript is done using [standard Python syntax](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Variables_and_Types). You can create as many variables as you like using a single Create Variable module by adding a new field to create each additional variable.

![Create variables by clicking &quot;+ Add Variable&quot; and assigning the variable&apos;s value to the variable&apos;s name.](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-01-15-at-1.27.56-pm.png)

![The type of each variable will be inferred and the variables will be created for use later in your script.](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-01-15-at-1.28.56-pm.png)
