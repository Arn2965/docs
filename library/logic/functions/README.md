  Functions are blocks of reusable logic, which you can run alone, or as part of
  your larger WayScript program.

# Functions

## ‚ñ∂ Main Function

When you first create a WayScript program, you will see one function, called "Main." By default, the Main function is the starting point for your WayScript program.

{% hint style="info" %}
You cannot delete the Main function, but you can rename it, or [define inputs/outputs](function-definition.md).
{% endhint %}

## ‚ûï Creating a New Function

To create a new function, click the **+** icon to the right of the function header. A new function tree will appear to the right of the previous function.

### ‚ùå Deleting a Function

To delete a function, hover over the header and click the **x** icon to the left of the function name.

## üìñ Next Steps

Once you have created a function, you can:

* [Edit the function definition ](function-definition.md)\(change its name or define inputs and outputs\)
* [Call the function](function-call.md) from elsewhere in your WayScript program
* [Return values](return.md) from the function
