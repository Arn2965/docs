## \*\*\*\*âš™ **Choose Your Inputs and Outputs**

Once you select a function to call, the inputs and outputs for that function will populate in the settings panel. Select your inputs and outputs as you would for any module.

## ðŸ”€ Running a Function Asynchronously

The **Run Async** setting in the Function Call module allows you to asynchronously call a function that runs an "expensive" or long-running task.  
  
One common use-case for this setting is to immediately return a `200 Success` response from the [HTTP Response](../../modules/http-response.md) module, while performing a long-running task in the background, on another thread.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is currently not possible to return outputs from an asynchronous function call.
