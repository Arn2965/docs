▶ So far in this introduction, we have run our programs by pressing the "Run Main" button. Whether you realized it or not - this button is a Trigger! 

⚡Trigger events cause your program to run. In the "Run Main" case, the Trigger is just pressing the button. However, there are many other types of triggers you can set up to run your programs.  

{% hint style="info" %}
A simple example of this is the [Time Trigger](../library/triggers/time-trigger.md).
{% endhint %}
