# Triggers

Triggers tell your WayScript program to run.

## What are Triggers?

▶ So far in this introduction, we have run our scripts by pressing the "Run Main" button. Whether you realized it or not - this button is a Trigger!

⚡Trigger events cause your script to run. In the "Run Main" case, the Trigger is just pressing the button. However, there are many other types of triggers you can set up to run your scripts.

{% hint style="info" %}
A simple example of this is the [Time Trigger](../library/triggers/time-trigger.md).
