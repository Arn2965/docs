# Code Editors

The ability to include code steps in your script allows power-users ultimate flexibility. With WayScript you can query your SQL database, manipulate data with Python or even build a website with JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

## Using Variables

Just like most inputs in WayScript, code editors allow you to drag variables directly into your code.

## Files

Each code editor, has its own 'local' file, and shares any 'global' files throughout your script with any other steps of the same type.

### Accessing Files

To work with files, click the chevron in the top-left corner of the code editor. You can add new global files for easy access throughout your script.
