## What is a condition?

In programming, a conditional \(also known as "[if-statement](../library/logic/conditionals.md#if-else)"\) is a control-flow statement directing your program to perform different actions depending on whether or not the programmer-specified _condition_ is `true` or `false`.

### ![](../.gitbook/assets/create_var.png)Create a Variable

For this example, we create a variable called Number and set it to the value 4.

### ![](../.gitbook/assets/conditional.png)Create a Condition

Drag the "If" module from your Logic Panel as the next step in your program.

### âš™Define Your Conditions

For this example, we want to build logic that says "**If** our Number variable is greater than or equal to 100 - then print "This is a big number", **Else** print "This is a small number".

### ðŸŒ²Add Branch Actions

We can now add different sets of actions to each **branch** of the conditional. If the condition is **True,** it will execute one set of actions, otherwise it will run a different set of actions.

### â–¶Run your Program

Press the "Run Main" button to run your program. You can see that the If-statement evaluated to False \(because 4 is not greater than or equal to 100\). Our program prints "This is a small number!".

Try changing the number of your Number variable and rerunning the program.
