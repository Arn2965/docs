# Text Message Trigger

You can trigger WayScript programs to run by sending a text message to WayScript at \(415\) WYS-CRPT \(+1 415 997 2778\)

## Phone Number Verification

If you haven't yet verified your phone number with your WayScript account, you will need to so before using this module. See [Phone Number Verification](../account-management/phone-number-verification.md) for details.

## New Variable Inputs

You can dynamically input new variable data into your program via text message. Specify these variables in the "Variables to Create" section.

## Sending a Text

Send your text message to \(415\) WYS-CRPT \(+1 415 997 2778\).

The text message body will be the program name, followed by a colon, then any variable values, all separated by commas.

For example, if you wanted to run your "Stocks" program with the arguments "AAPL" and "MSFT", your message body would be "Stocks:AAPL,MSFT"
