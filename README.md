## What is WayScript?

WayScript is a drag and drop programming platform built to give you superpowers. Unlike many visual programming platforms, WayScript is a programming language with variables, functions, recursion, logic, and much more. We manage all the third-party APIs for you, as well as the cloud infrastructure, so you don't have to. WayScript programs you create can be seamlessly shared with your team, company, friends, and the WayScript community.

## YouTube Tutorials

We publish weekly [YouTube tutorials](https://youtube.com/c/wayscript) of use cases, functionality, and much more. 

## Privacy Stance

We care about your privacy. We are not sharing data about you with advertisers nor anybody else.
