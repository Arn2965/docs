# About WayScript

## What is WayScript?

WayScript is a drag and drop programming platform built to give you superpowers. Unlike many visual programming platforms, WayScript is a programming language which can use variables, functions, recursion, programmatic logic, and much more. WayScript manages third-party APIs so you don't have to, and lets you seamlessly share your tools with others.
